# SHACKS

For Scotiabank Hacks 2023, we decided to tackle the theme of sustainability by tackling the issues surrounding modern fraud reporting systems. As such, we present to you SafeGuard by Scotiabank, an AI-powered chatbot that makes reporting fraud a much quicker process, cutting out the need to actually call a representative. Along with the chatbot, we also present a progress tracker, to increase communication between banks and worried customers.
